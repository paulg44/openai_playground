# openai_playground

I have another personal game project where I possibly need the use of AI to compare two images for likeness. As that other repository is already quite complex, before I add another element (AI) I would like to learn a bit more about how it all works, test some theories out, see if what I want to do is possible and make sure I understand how the rate limit etc works so that I'm not running up huge bills.
